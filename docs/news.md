With great excitement, CertiKFoundation announces that the CertiK Chain has now entered the Open Beta Testing phase. Today the first Open Beta Testnet, 3.0, went online.

Thank you all the alpha testers for your patient and participation!

Open Beta Testing means anyone, without the need to register, can participate in testing. With that, this CertiK Chain User Group has also been opened up to the public.

Note that the old Alpha Testnet 1.0 and 2.0 have since been deprecated, with all test accounts and tokens gone as well. So you will need to recreate your test accounts, request CKTs and CKGs from the faucet, and optionally get your node certified again to serve as validator.

Please visit https://github.com/certikfoundation/chain for chain binaries and guide. From now on, all chain access info will be posted there.
